        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Oatmeal raisin cookies are delectable! One of my favorite desserts, it has a great
            earthy and cinnamon taste to them. They are super easy to make and only take about
            an hour to make, an hour to chill, and 45 minutes to bake!

            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Molasses</li>
            <li>Pure Vanilla Extract + Salt</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a mixer, cream the softened butter and both sugars together until smooth for about two minutes.
                Add eggs and mix on high until combined for about one minute. Add vanilla extract and molasses and mix
                on high until combined. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together. Add the wet ingredients
                and mix on low until combined. Beat in the oats and raisins on low speed. The dough will be thick and sticky.
                Chill the dough for about 30-60 minutes in the fridge.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line two large backing sheets with parchment paper, set aside
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll balls of dough and place 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. This will allow the cookies to have room
                to grow. Bake for 12-14 minutes until lightly browned on the sides. Center will look very soft and and
                under-baked. Remove from the oven and let it cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring
                to a wire rack to cool.
